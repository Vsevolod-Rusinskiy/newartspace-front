## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, please report it via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (preferred)
   - Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the Security tab
   - This allows for private communication and coordinated disclosure

2. **Email** (if GitHub reporting is unavailable)
   - Contact the maintainers directly

## Security Response Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
3. We will keep you informed of our progress
4. We will notify you when the vulnerability has been resolved

## What to Include in Your Report

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

## Recognition

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit security researchers who help us improve our security (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep our project secure!
